# Fall-Detection-and-Alert-System

•	Designed an Arduino UNO-based ‘Non-Wearable’ Fall Detection System for the elderly in privacy sensitive areas
•	Prototyped using PIR, IR and ultrasonic sensors. Interfaced a GSM-based alert system and a servo motor-based door unlocking system to reduce response time to falls

Use Arduino IDE for running the .ino file.
